Meetings aren't held during the summer months, or during the final-exams week. Our meetings are generally informal, and all members of the MSOE community are welcome to attend. Meeting activities typically include: Socializing with your fellow students Planning & brainstorming future club events Getting on our own 2m repeater and making short-range contacts Getting on the HF radio and making voice and digital long-range contacts Tours of our equipment in various locations around campus (for new members) Presentations on subjects such as Emergency Communications, Satellites, Radio Sports If you are a member of the greater Amateur Radio Community (not affiliated with MSOE) we welcome you to contact us and attend by invitation. We routinely have visitors from other ARCs around the Milwaukee Area, but please check in with us first! Club History The MSOE Amateur Radio Club was founded in 1914 at the Milwaukee School of Engineering, making it the longest running organization at our university. Over the years, we've been home to students of all majors and backgrounds as a fun place to hang out, discuss technical subjects, learn outside the classroom about RF and wireless technology, and get on the radio to make contacts.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-the-msoe-amateur-radio-club","text":"","title":"About the MSOE Amateur Radio Club"},{"location":"about/#meetings","text":"Meetings of the MSOE Amateur Radio Club (W9HHX) are held on Fridays while school is in session at MSOE in room 1203 of the MLH Dorm Building from Noon to 1pm.

These events are a great way get involved with the club beyond attending meetings! We try to run these major events every year. High Altitude Pico-Balloon Launch At our yearly High Altitude Balloon Launch, we attach a small radio transmitter to a large Mylar balloon, fill the balloon with helium, set up a ground tracking station, and release the balloon over Lake Michigan! With APRS (Automated Packet Reporting System) capabilities, the balloon payload's transmissions of GPS position data are received by many stations around the globe as it traverses the world in the jetstream! Stations that receive these transmissions upload the position of the balloon to the internet, where its progress can be tracked by everyone, making it a very cool experiment. These balloons are known to travel at speeds of up to 120MPH for many weeks before popping. Hidden Transmitter Hunt Radio Hide-and-Seek! We hide a small transmitter which sends out a morse code message every few minutes, and then attempt to locate it through the use of directional antennas and triangulation. Ozaukee Amateur Radio Club Swapfest Amateur Radio Swapfests are a great way to meet new people in the hobby, and to buy or sell radio equipment. They're essentially huge yardsales for all types of electronics equipment! If you can think it up, it will probably be there at the larger swapfests. The biggest swapfest that many radio enthusiasts try to attend is the Dayton 'Hamvention', but there are many more moderately sized ones around Milwaukee which we like to attend for the afternoon. Amateur Radio License Day As a club, we support students who are studying to get their amateur radio license from the FCC by providing free study materials, a wealth of knowledge in our already-licensed members, and if possible, even transportation to the testing location. Oftentimes the best way to learn is to jump right in, so we welcome all MSOE students to our club, regardless of if they want to earn their license! Licensing days are usually held at Ham Radio Outlet on Good Hope Rd. in Milwaukee, at the end of each month. NACC Collegiate Championship Contest Every January, we gather up in the Club Room to try to make the most contacts as possible in this fun Radio Sport contest. We compete against other colleges around the nation, and the bands are full of stations eager to make contact with us-- sometimes they even coincidentally turn out to be MSOE Alumni from years gone by! The goal of this contest is to make as many location-diverse contacts as possible in 24 hours. We typically order pizza or some other takeout for lunch, and everyone has a great time!","title":"Events"},{"location":"events/#events-activities-we-participate-in","text":"Our weekly meetings are mostly for socializing and getting on-the-air, but we also take time to plan events.
