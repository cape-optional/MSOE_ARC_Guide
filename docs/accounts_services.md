# Online Accounts and Services

> The W9HHX Radio Club has various online accounts and services it uses for many purposes. These accounts are documented here. All passwords to these accounts may be found in the W9HHX Password book. Ask a club officer or advisor for help.

## Canva

The Canva service is great for making good-looking posters and promo-materials with ease. This account is linked with the w9hhx.radio@gmail.com email account. To log in, simply select "log in with Google" on the Canva Website. A selection of posters designed in 2019/2020 are available in this account for your re-use after updating dates/times/locations.

## Google

https://www.google.com

The email account for the Radio Club is w9hhx.radio@gmail.com. This email may be used to login to Google, and from there you have access to the Club Gmail account and the Google Drive files. 

### Gmail

The Gmail account should be the official email of the club that is listed on all posters and external facing materials, however, it has been found that an Outlook group is best for internal club communication.

### GDrive

The Google Drive holds many useful files and documentation, including club photos, examples of posters, software installers (may be outdated) member lists/rosters, and other administration documents. This drive should not be used for personal files, and an effort should be made to categorize everything into a folder so there are no loose files with questionable importance floating about.

## QRZ

QRZ is a website where people can look up W9HHX and learn about our station and club in general. It's almost like an online QSL card. As of Feb 2020, we need to figure out how to manage our own QRZ page. It is currently managed by Rich Phillips AA9L, longtime club member.

## RemoteRig Box Web Interfaces

*(See [RemoteRig page](remoterig.md) for web addresses)*

The RemoteRig web interfaces require username/password to modify settings. The username for all of the RemoteRig web interface pages is simply "W9HHX" without the quotes. Passwords may be found in the W9HHX password book.

## Facebook

https://www.facebook.com/W9HHX/

We use Facebook for advertising, but mainly to people outside MSOE. The majority of the Facebook followers are MSOE alumni or people from the greater Amateur Radio Community. If your target demographic is students of MSOE, posters or emails are better. You do not log into the W9HHX page directly. You must be made into a contributor, and then you can sign in with your own Facebook username and password. From your page, access W9HHX under "Your Pages". 

## Twitter

https://twitter.com/w9hhx/followers

The username for our Twitter page (rarely used as opposed to email and even Facebook) is @W9HHX. Don't expect a huge response to tweets sent from this account - I don't think many students know it exists. Furthermore, not many students use twitter at all to our knowledge --Students, 2020
