# Recruitment & Org Fair

> An important part of running a Radio Club effectively is the recruitment of new members and the advertisement of the club its activities.

## The Org Fair

The Campus Life / Student Life department coordinates a student organization fair on the first Friday of each school year (Fall Quarter, Friday of Week 1: 17.00 -- 19.00).  The radio club showing at this event is easily the most effective way to attract new members, so to attend it is a must.  There is typically one club meeting before the Org Fair (the same day), which is a good opportunity to prepare the club's table for the event.



### Table Setup

It is important to have an interesting display at the Org Fair to catch the eye of prospective student members. Examples of items that could be set up at the fair include:

- Yeasu FT-950 (It would be awesome to set up for remote operation w/ RemoteRig)

- Microphone

- Morse Code Straight Key and Practice Oscillator

- QSL Cards (Pick some interesting, colorful ones from the bins in MLH)

- *Recent* contest awards

- World Map and W9HHX Cork Board with photos and info

- Color version of general advertising poster

- Another laptop to record email addresses and names

  

### Talking Tips

Have prepared a "1 minute spiel" about why they might want to try out the Amateur Radio Club.  While you might know that Amateur Radio can be on the cutting edge of radio-technology, most people stopping by your table probably only have a vague idea of what "ham radio" is.  You should be able to project that amateur radio is much more than old guys pounding on Morse code keys, but that it in fact casts a vast net.  If they give you a topic they like there's likely some way that radio's a part of it.  Feel free to talk about digital modes (for the mic shy), image modes (for the technically savvy), and contesting or operators on the International Space Station (for the adventurous).  If they are worried about having to attend each week, let them know that the club doesn't require regular attendance and that they should at he very least try to come to a club event / contest to see what we're about.  

DON’T: 

- Don’t swamp people down with technical details. Use mostly familiar language. People want fun, not an electromagnetics lecture!
- Don’t use acronyms. Nobody will know what SDR, HF, VHF, etc. mean. Saying what they stand for is OK if necessary, but only if those words that make up the acronym are familiar to them.
- Don’t assume they know anything about radio---ask if they know anything about it and measure your response by that. Often times they’ll recognize ham radio as something a grandparent or family friend does as a hobby.

DO:

- Talk about how we have a lot of fun, have opportunities to make friends, and talk to other people around the world.

- Remember that there are many ways to participate in radio, from the technical side to just picking up the mic, and all are fun!

- Be friendly and smile- treat everyone as a friend.

- Ask everyone their name and shake their hand when they leave. It makes a good impression!

- Give examples of some past and upcoming events the club likes.

  - For 	example: the NACC contest, High Altitude Balloons, presentations, 	etc.

- Share your enthusiasm for radio!

- Have two people at the booth in case a bunch of students come at once.

  

### Demonstration

Beyond showing a bunch of complicated equipment, a simple demonstration should be prepared to show that Amateur Radio really requires no experience.  Stress lies on *simple* in "simple demonstration".  Your audience will be intimidated if the demo requires too much foreknowledge, and will feel more welcome if the demo is easy to understand.  Remember: most students attending the org fair will be freshmen with but a week's worth of engineering knowledge, others might be nursing students, biomed students, et al. 

A few demonstration ideas to get you started:

- Laptop with SDR demo showing car key-fob spectrum (Was a hit during Fall 2019)

- "Fox Hunt" using a HT w/ directional antenna and hidden transmitter

  

### After the Org Fair

After the fair, follow these suggested steps:

1) Add everyone’s email who signed up to the Outlook Group.

2) Send out a short welcome email the day after the fair.

3) About half a week out from the next club meeting, send out a meeting reminder email. It is best if there can be free food/snacks at this meeting! That’s an incentive to come.

4) The day of the meeting, send out one more short reminder email.
