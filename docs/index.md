# Welcome to the MSOE ARC Guide
> Welcome to the Milwaukee School of Engineering Amateur Radio Club, the longest running student organization at MSOE! Our club participates in contesting, high altitude ballooning, and hidden transmitter hunts, and we offer materials and support for students who want to earn or upgrade their amateur radio license. All members of the MSOE community are welcome at our meetings.

## Overview
This documentation should serve to be an introduction to some of the many aspects of Amateur Radio, as well as a guide to many of the specifics of the MSOE Amateur Radio Club's equipment and the opportunities the club allows.  Some information about the Milwaukee area and how it may be leveraged to the benefit of the club is also provided.  The hope is that this guide become a useful reference for future members of the club, which might serve to help in times brain-bashing ("why is this wire here?!", "how do I fix the networked radio link?!") or wandering ("what do we even do as a 'radio club'...?").
