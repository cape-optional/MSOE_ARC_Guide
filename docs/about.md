# About the MSOE Amateur Radio Club

## Meetings

Meetings of the MSOE Amateur Radio Club (W9HHX) are held on Fridays while school is in session at MSOE in room 1203 of the MLH Dorm Building from Noon to 1pm. Meetings aren't held during the summer months, or during the final-exams week.

Our meetings are generally informal, and all members of the MSOE community are welcome to attend. Meeting activities typically include:

- Socializing with your fellow students
- Planning & brainstorming future club events
- Getting on our own 2m repeater and making short-range contacts
- Getting on the HF radio and making voice and digital long-range contacts
- Tours of our equipment in various locations around campus (for new members)
- Presentations on subjects such as Emergency Communications, Satellites, Radio Sports

If you are a member of the greater Amateur Radio Community (not affiliated with MSOE) we welcome you to contact us and attend by invitation. We routinely have visitors from other ARCs around the Milwaukee Area, but please check in with us first!



## Club History

The MSOE Amateur Radio Club was founded in 1914 at the Milwaukee School of Engineering, making it the longest running organization at our university. Over the years, we've been home to students of all majors and backgrounds as a fun place to hang out, discuss technical subjects, learn outside the classroom about RF and wireless technology, and get on the radio to make contacts.
